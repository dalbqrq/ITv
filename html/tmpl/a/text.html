			<p>WordPress is an open source blog publishing application. It is the official successor of b2\cafelog, developed by Michel Valdrighi. The name WordPress was suggested by Christine Selleck, a friend of lead developer Matt Mullenweg.</p>
			<p>I’m working on fixing well-known bugs for an upcoming release and looking forward to finally submitting this theme to the Wordpress Theme Directory. I’ve also added a Paypal button so you guys can donate if you want/feel to. To all of you who donated, thanks!</p>
